                <strong><small>games</small> </strong>
                <p><blockquote>I aboslutely love playing games. Some of my
                    favorite series to play is Pokemon and Kingdom Hearts. You 
                    can usually find me playing League of Legends and Valorant
                    when I have time! I am also a huge board game fanatics, if 
                    you look close enough behind me in class, you could see a 
                    glimpse of my gigantic board game collection. I love 
                    hosting board game nights for me friends; it is always a 
                    good time yelling and screaming at each other.

                <strong><small>music</small> </strong>
                <p><blockquote>I enjoy listening to EDM musics, and some of my
                    favorite DJs are Alesso and Porter Robinson. When I am not 
                    I am not listening to EDM, people will usually hear me sing 
                    Ariana Grande or Justin Bieber. I am actually trying to 
                    open up my own Karaoke business at the moment too! Also, I 
                    have to mention my love for KPOP and love groups like 
                    Infinite and Sistar.

                <strong><small>movies and shows</small> </strong>
                <p><blockquote>I am a huge Disney nerd and my favorite movies 
                    are Finding Nemo and Big Hero 6. I am the worst person to 
                    watch a Horror movie with because I am screaming and 
                    jumping all over the place, but I love watching them. My 
                    favorite show of all time is Survivor and Rupaul's Drag 
                    Race. I also enjoy binging Anime like Hunter x Hunter and
                    Yu Yu Hakusho.

                <h1><br>why i want to become a web developer</h1>
                <strong><small>next chapter</small> </strong>
                <p><blockquote>After this portfolio project, I am not sure if building 
                    websites will be my thing, but that's why I am here to 
                    learn from Coding Temple! But in seriousness, I am doing a 
                    huge career change. I was unhappy being in the front of
                     house in hospitality. I feel like I am more of a behind 
                     the scenes type of guy. I have practiced and I love that 
                     coding is like a huge logic puzzle and really feel that 
                     this has to be the next step in my life. I do not know 
                     what industry I want to be in, but hopefully after 
                     attending Coding Temple, I will find the best career for 
                     me. This will allow me to live the future I envision for 
                     myself.
